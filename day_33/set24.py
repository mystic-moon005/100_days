# only ints
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 0}
print(sum(set1))


'''
# only tuples
# tuples within tuples
set2 = {(9, 7, 8), (4, 5, 6), (1, 2, 3)}
print(sum(set2))

OUTPUT:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'tuple'

cant add


ALSO -- theres no point in trying out the multiple datatype eg
that too wont work so yea :P
